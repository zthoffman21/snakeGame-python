# snakeGame-python
This is the classic snake game made in python using pygame

-The "main" branch is version 1. In this version, it is classic snake, but when you die the window closes and a new window appears showing the score.
-The "updated score" is version 2. In this version, it is the same as version 1, but instead of a new window appearing, the score is displayed on the window where the 
  game was held.
-The "added restart button..." is version 3. In this version, it is the same as version 2, but you can now use wasd to move in addition to the arrow key, once you die 
  you can hit 'r' to restart instead of replaying the code, and hitting the esc will end the game/ close the window.
